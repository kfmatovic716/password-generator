* When generate button is clicked then presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
* When prompted for password criterias then confirm criterias
* When prompted for the length of the password, choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
* When asked for character types to include in the password, confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
* When each prompt is answered, inputs should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
* When all prompts are answered, a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
* When the password is generated, the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page

# Learning Points
* Learned to work with Javacript data structures, functions, arrays, operators,conditional loops like for, while, if statements and the use of some basic methods
* Tested how each of these topics work by printing out results via console.log
* Tried to write pseudocode to get an idea of how to structure code
* Learned new way of converting data -> spread operator (...) to turn any string into an array of single-characters
* Enhanced skill at Google-Fu -> learned to think about more specific prompting search in order to get better results
